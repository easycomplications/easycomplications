<p1> Feelings can be complicated. <br> Sometimes most of us, engaged in our daily and mundane lives, fail to express how we feel. <br> We at Easy Complications make this possible through various mediums like personalised letters, emails, cards, poems etc. </p1>

<p2> Take a step forward to strengthen your bond with your loved ones or even your employees. Yes, you read it right. Employee motivation is a complex thing definitely. <br> At some point in time, money no longer remains the motivation. We all know about Maslow's need heirarchy pyramid but all the working employees are no where above the second level of the pyramid. Motivation begins with clear communication, a bit of a personal touch and a feeling that the employer acknowledges their hard work and is grateful to have them. </p2>

<p3> This world is unpleasant and unfair as it is. Some kind words can make someone smile. <br> Take a step forward to strengthen your relationships by filling out the form and we will get in touch with you. </p3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p4> PS: You don't need any special day to express your feelings to anyone. Just seize the day and make it special because if tomorrow comes, it should be sans regret! </p4>
